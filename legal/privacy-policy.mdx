## Plain English

AI workers bring challenges to current privacy practices that have not been dealt with before, and we are committed to creating the best possible privacy practices for our users.

To illustrate the challenge, consider the following scenario:

You have an AI assistant that can access your entire calendar and email. If you then direct your AI assistant to send an email to another person, it will send the email, potentially including content from your email and calendar.
In effect, our product is sharing your private data with a third party (with your consent), and you could direct your AI assistant to send an email to any third party with an email address. For that reason, our privacy policy is written broadly, 
because we cannot control how our users use our product to share their own data with other people or other parties.

That said, we do not share your data with any third parties without your consent, and we do not sell your data to any third parties. We do not use your data for any purpose other than to provide you with our services. You can delete your account at 
any time, and we will delete your data within 30 days (and likely much, much sooner).
