By (1) mutually executing one or more order forms with Time that reference these Platform Terms (each, an “**Order Form**”), (2) clicking a box indicating acceptance, or (3) using the services, you (“**Customer**”) agree to be bound by these Platform Terms (together with all Order Forms, the “**Agreement**”) to the exclusion of all other terms.
