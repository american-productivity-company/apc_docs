These User Terms (the "**User Terms**") govern your access and use of Time's services (the "**Services**"). By accessing or using the Services, or continuing to access or use the Services after being notified of a change to these User Terms, you confirm that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these User Terms.

"**Time**," "**we**," "**our**," and "**us**" refer to American Productivity Company, doing business as Time or the applicable Time affiliate identified in any separate agreement (defined below).

Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how we collect and use data relating to the use and performance of our products.

1. Relationship to Customer
An organization or other third party that we refer to in these User Terms as "**Customer**" has invited you to use the Services as part of a "**Team**" (i.e., a unique space where a group of users may access the Services).

Example: If you are joining one of your employer's Teams, then Customer is your employer.
Example: If you are joining a Team created by a friend (using their personal email address), that friend is our Customer and is authorizing you to join their Team.
Customer has separately agreed to our Platform Terms or entered into a written agreement with Time or its affiliate(s) (in either case, the "**Agreement**") that permits Customer to create and configure a Team. The Agreement contains our commitment to deliver the Services to Customer, who may then invite authorized individuals (including you) to join the Team. Such individuals granted access to the Services are referred to as "**Authorized Users**."

When an Authorized User (including you) submits content or information to the Services ("**Customer Data**"), you acknowledge and agree that:

Ownership. Customer owns all Customer Data.
Control. The Agreement provides Customer with many choices and control over Customer Data, including the ability to:
Provision or deprovision your access to the Services,
Enable or disable third-party integrations,
Manage permissions, retention, and export settings,
Transfer, assign, or consolidate Teams.
These choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification, or deletion of certain or all Customer Data.

2. Duration and Termination of User Terms
These User Terms remain effective until:

Customer's subscription for you expires or terminates, or
Your access to the Services has been terminated by Customer or by Time.
If at any time or for any reason you wish to terminate your account, you should contact Customer (e.g., your employer or the person who invited you).

3. Customer Responsibilities
AS BETWEEN TIME AND CUSTOMER, YOU AGREE THAT IT IS SOLELY CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO:

(A) Inform you and any Authorized Users of any relevant Customer policies and practices and any settings that may impact the processing of Customer Data;
(B) Obtain any rights, permissions, or consents from you and any Authorized Users necessary for the lawful use of Customer Data and the operation of the Services, including, without limitation, as required by applicable laws governing the monitoring or recording of conversations ("**Recording Laws**");
(C) Ensure that the transfer and processing of Customer Data under the Agreement is lawful; and
(D) Respond to and resolve any dispute with you and any Authorized User relating to or based on Customer Data, the Services, or Customer's failure to fulfill these obligations.

TIME MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO YOU RELATING TO THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

4. Age Requirements; Representations
Minimum Age

To the extent prohibited by applicable law, the Services are not intended for and should not be used by:
(a) anyone under the age of sixteen (16), or
(b) anyone under the applicable age of majority under data protection laws in your jurisdiction.
You represent that you are over the legal age and are the intended recipient of Customer's invitation to the Services. If this is not true, you may not access or use the Services.
Your Representations
You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not provide or contribute anything, including any Customer Data, to the Services or otherwise use or interact with the Services in a manner that:

Violates any law or regulation, including export control laws, privacy laws, or Recording Laws;
Is dangerous, fraudulent, harassing, defamatory, or obscene;
Jeopardizes the security of your account or anyone else's account (e.g., allowing unauthorized access);
Attempts to obtain the password, account, or security information of others;
Violates the security of any computer network or attempts to crack any passwords or security encryption codes;
Runs spam or auto-responders on the Services or otherwise interferes with the Services' proper working;
Scrapes or crawls any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services (manually or automatically);
Copies or stores any significant portion of content made available through the Services;
Decompiles or reverse engineers any source code or underlying ideas of the Services.
A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.

5. Our Enforcement Rights
If we believe there is a violation of the Agreement, these User Terms, or any of our other policies:

We will often notify Customer first (e.g., ask them to remove certain Customer Data or take other action).
If Customer does not remedy the situation or we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties, we may take action directly, including disabling your account.
6. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN AGREEMENT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

UNLESS YOU ARE ALSO A CUSTOMER (AND WITHOUT LIMITATION TO OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE AGREEMENT), YOU WILL HAVE NO FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO US FOR A BREACH OF THESE USER TERMS. OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY BREACH OF THESE USER TERMS IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND DO NOT LIMIT EITHER PARTY'S RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN EQUITABLE RELIEF.
